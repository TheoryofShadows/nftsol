# NFTSol Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying your NFTSol marketplace to GitHub and various hosting platforms.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Your NFTSol application is now ready for deployment! The logo issue has been fixed and all components are working properly.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

‚úÖ Logo and icons are working (replaced Font Awesome with SVG icons)  
‚úÖ Responsive design implemented  
‚úÖ Build configuration is ready  
‚úÖ Environment files are configured  
‚úÖ Git repository is ready  

## üêô GitHub Deployment

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository named `nftsol`
2. Choose "Public" for open source or "Private" for proprietary code
3. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### 2. Push to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: NFTSol marketplace with fixed logo and SVG icons"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nftsol.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## üåê Hosting Platform Deployment

### Option 1: Replit Deployments (Recommended)

1. Click the "Deploy" button in your Replit interface
2. Choose your deployment settings
3. Your app will be live at `your-repl-name.replit.app`

**Pros:** Simple, integrated, automatic HTTPS, built-in database

### Option 2: Vercel

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
3. Add environment variables if needed
4. Deploy automatically on every GitHub push

**Pros:** Fast global CDN, automatic preview deployments, excellent for React apps

### Option 3: Netlify

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `dist`
3. Add environment variables if needed
4. Deploy automatically on every GitHub push

**Pros:** Great static site hosting, form handling, serverless functions

### Option 4: Railway

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Railway will automatically detect your Node.js app
3. Add environment variables for database
4. Deploy with automatic scaling

**Pros:** Full-stack hosting, database included, Docker support

## üîß Environment Variables

Make sure to set these environment variables in your hosting platform:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_session_secret
PORT=5000
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### For Replit Deployments
- Use the built-in PostgreSQL database
- Database credentials are automatically provided

### For External Hosting
1. Create a PostgreSQL database (recommended providers):
   - Neon (serverless PostgreSQL)
   - Supabase (open source Firebase alternative)
   - PlanetScale (MySQL with Git-like workflow)
   - Railway (integrated with hosting)

2. Update your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

3. Run database migrations:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

## üì¶ Build Process

The application uses a modern build system:

- **Frontend**: Vite builds the React application to `dist/`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles the Express server
- **Assets**: All static assets are optimized and fingerprinted

Build command: `npm run build`

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to Git
2. **Session Secrets**: Use strong, unique session secrets in production
3. **Database**: Use connection pooling and read replicas for production
4. **HTTPS**: All hosting platforms provide automatic HTTPS
5. **CORS**: Configure CORS for your production domain

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check Node.js version compatibility (requires Node 18+)
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

### Logo Not Showing
‚úÖ **Fixed!** We replaced Font Awesome with custom SVG icons.

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` format: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`
- Check firewall settings allow connections from your hosting platform
- Ensure database server is running and accessible

### Performance Issues
- Enable gzip compression
- Use a CDN for static assets
- Implement database query optimization
- Add caching layers (Redis)

## üìà Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Test all functionality**:
   - Navigation and routing
   - Wallet connection UI
   - Responsive design on mobile
   - Search functionality
   - Newsletter signup

2. **Set up monitoring**:
   - Error tracking (Sentry)
   - Analytics (Google Analytics)
   - Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot)

3. **Configure custom domain** (optional):
   - Purchase domain from registrar
   - Configure DNS settings
   - Enable SSL certificate

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Solana Integration**: Add real wallet connectivity (Phantom, Solflare)
2. **NFT Data**: Connect to Solana NFT APIs or marketplaces
3. **User Authentication**: Implement wallet-based authentication
4. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for live price updates
5. **Mobile App**: Consider React Native for mobile experience

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the logs in your hosting platform
2. Review the GitHub Issues page
3. Contact support through your hosting platform
4. Join the Solana developer community for NFT-specific questions

**Congratulations!** Your NFTSol marketplace is ready for the world. The modern design, working logo, and responsive layout will provide users with an excellent NFT trading experience on Solana.
