# üåê NFTSol Deployment URL Customization Guide

## Current URL Issue
Your app is currently deployed at: `sol-heatherjones530.replit.app` which includes personal information.

## Solutions to Fix URL

### Option 1: Create New Repl with Better Name (Recommended)
**Steps:**
1. Create a new Repl with a professional name like:
   - `nftsol-marketplace`
   - `solana-nft-hub` 
   - `nft-trading-platform`
2. Import this project code into the new Repl
3. Deploy from the new Repl

**Result:** Clean URL like `nftsol-marketplace.replit.app`

### Option 2: Custom Domain (Professional Solution)
**Steps:**
1. Purchase a domain name (e.g., `nftsol.app`, `mynftmarketplace.com`)
2. In Replit Deployment settings ‚Üí Add Custom Domain
3. Configure DNS records as provided by Replit
4. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

**Result:** Professional URL like `nftsol.app` or `marketplace.yourdomain.com`

### Option 3: Use Replit's Domain Purchase (Beta)
**Steps:**
1. In Replit Deployment settings ‚Üí "Buy Domain"
2. Search for available domains related to your marketplace
3. Purchase directly through Replit (auto-configures)

**Result:** Instantly configured custom domain

## Mobile Layout Fix Applied

I've already fixed the mobile layout issue by:

**Stats Cards Repositioning:**
- ‚úÖ Moved stats section down to prevent overlap
- ‚úÖ Reduced padding on mobile screens
- ‚úÖ Made text smaller on mobile for better fit
- ‚úÖ Added responsive breakpoints for clean mobile view
- ‚úÖ Centered layout with max-width for better mobile UX

**Mobile-Specific Improvements:**
- Responsive text sizing (smaller on mobile)
- Better spacing between elements
- Line breaks optimized for small screens
- Cards now properly sized for mobile viewing

## Immediate Action Needed

**For Clean Professional URL:**
1. Create new Repl with name: `nftsol-marketplace`
2. Copy all project files to new Repl
3. Deploy from new Repl location
4. Update any documentation with new URL

**No Code Changes Required:** The mobile layout is now fixed and will work properly once redeployed from a clean URL.

Your marketplace will then be accessible at a professional URL like:
`https://nftsol-marketplace.replit.app`

This provides a much better first impression for users and removes any personal information from the public URL.
